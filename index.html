At CogniBase we believe that truthfulness must be a natural condition of Large Language Models (LLM). 
</p>
To achieve this, we aim to create a human-curated, unbiased, and non-opiniated knowledge base of facts accessible to anyone, anywhere. This knowledge base will be structured by themes and topics and will be extended systematically.
<p>
Currently, non-truthful responses in LLM are often addressed by accessing multiple websites for additional information, which sometime leads to incomplete and biased results. This is why human revision is necessary.
</p>
We plan to realize our ambitious goal by using cutting-edge natural language processing technology. Autonomous agents powered by GPT-4 will create the database of facts from the internet and guide the human revision, checking on biases and opiniated texts and will monitor the sources, for newly created knowledge. 
<p>
Our revenues will come from subscriptions to our chat platform, advertising for those free subscribers, pay-per-use of our cloud-based API and leasing our ever-growing knowledge base to third-party organizations. With our diverse streams of revenue, we can ensure rapid growth and provide measurable advances month after month. 
</p>
<p>
The need for reliable information will grow exponentially as LLM becomes more widely used and CogniBase is poised to become the go-to platform for expanding knowledge and accelerating learning. Join us today and be part of the future of cognitive enhancement powered by truthful AI!
