The evolution of data manipulation is often depicted as a progression, moving from traditional databases to advanced data warehouses, and further evolving into the concept of data lakes. Beyond the difference in the type of data and the structures that they can handle, there is the need to create data transformation workflows before the data is ready for end-user needs, such as reporting, management, and analytical functionalities. 

Data lakes, housing vast amounts of diverse information, have undergone transformation by incorporating innovative concepts like Lakehouses, introducing some degree of structuring to enhance usability and the concept of data mesh with its fragmentation and distribution strategies, making data easier to maintain and utilize. 

However, harnessing the full potential of the data necessitates the expertise of skilled data analysts who craft intricate data transformation workflows. These workflows involve gathering data from various sources until the desired data set is obtained. 

The idea of automating the creation of these workflows has been the aspiration of researchers leading to the creation of important concepts like metainformation and the logical modeling of the information, but that didn't lead to any breakthrough in this field. 

Recent advances in LLM (Large Language Models) have shed light on the limitations of the previously mentioned ideas, which, while not entirely erroneous, have proven insufficient in tackling the intricacies of contemporary data manipulation. In response to these challenges, the concept of 'CogniLake' comes to the forefront. 

At its core, 'CogniLake' retains the fundamental notion of describing each data element with metainformation. However, it harnesses the power of LLM models to automatically generate the necessary workflows for data retrieval, extraction, transformation, and presentation in the desired format. This fusion of advanced language models with data management offers an exciting and innovative path towards streamlining and optimizing the entire data manipulation process, opening new possibilities for enhanced data utilization, and understanding.     <br/><br/>
